# MyToken Solidity Contract

This Solidity contract implements a basic token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of a token contract written in Solidity.

## Functionality

- Token Name and Symbol: The token contract includes public variables for the token name and symbol.
- Total Supply: Tracks the total supply of tokens.
- Token Balances: Stores token balances for each address.
- Minting Tokens: Allows creating new tokens and assigning them to addresses.
- Burning Tokens: Allows token holders to burn their own tokens, reducing the total supply.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Call the `mint` function to create and assign tokens.
3. Use the `burn` function to burn tokens when needed.
